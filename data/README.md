# Datasets


## Data source 1

This is the first set of data sets with which we worked since the beginning of 2017.

The "seqadded" files are loaded, features are extracted and then the data is pickled into "pkl" files.

The following table lists all available datasets, along with the file containing the training and testing data.

| Dataset  | Train file | Test file |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset 1 | 270  | 269  |

* Note: the data files are not uploaded to GitHub, but can be transferred upon request.


## Data source 2

This is a new set of data sets that Faizy found on which ortholog pooling did not seem to work.

The extensions of the sequence/label files are .center.4.2k (don't know what it means)

The following table lists all available datasets, along with the file containing the training and testing data.

| Dataset  | Train file | Test file |
|---|---|---|
| Dataset 1 | 564  | 563  |
