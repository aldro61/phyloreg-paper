## Status updates

### July 16 2017

* Results for training on #270 and testing on #269:
  * PhyloRR: AUC of 0.7113 on test
  * RR: AUC of 0.7690

### July 14-15 2017

* Wrote code to select the hyperparameters of ridge regression with and without phylo regularization.
* Launched computations on a single data set (270-269 data files).
* Results to come shortly
