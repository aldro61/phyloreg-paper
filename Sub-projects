1. Logistic Regression V/s Phylogenetic Manifold Logistic Regression
Result: 
a) ___ is better in terms of AUC on test set. Hyperparameters were learned using grid search over
range of parameters.
b) _____ is better in terms of AUC on test set. Hyperparameters were learned using simple-spearmint tool.

2. Ridge Regression V/s Phylogenetic Manifold Ridge Regression
Result:
a) __ is better in terms of AUC on test set. Hyperparameters were selected as described in 1.a
b) ____ is better in terms of AUC on test set. Hyperparameters were selected as described in 1.b

3. Pooled Logistic Regression V/s Phylogenetic Manifold Logistic Regression
Result:
a) PLR is better in terms of AUC on test set. PLR's Hyperparameters were learned 
using grid search on train set with 10-fold cross validation. While, PMLR's hyper-parameters
were selected by training on train set with range of values and by AUC score on test set.
b) ______ is better in terms of AUC on test set. Hyperparameters were learned as described in 1.b

4. Pooled Ridge Regression V/s Phylogenetic Manifold Ridge Regression
Result:
a) PRR is better in terms of AUC on test set. Hyperparameters were learned as described in 3.a
b) ____ is better in terms of AUC on test set. Hyperparameters were learned as described in 1.b

5. di-mismatch string kernel SVM >> Pooled Logistic Regression >= Weighted Pooled Logistic Regression >> Phylogenetic Manifold Logistic Regression
[ Hyperparameters of first was learned using 10-fold CV, 
of second and third were learned using grid search,
while for PMLR as described in 1.b ]
